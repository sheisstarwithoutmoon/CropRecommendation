# CropReccomendation
# Overview
The dataset contains information related to soil composition and environmental factors in order to predict the suitable crop for a particular region.

# Dataset
The goal is to make a crop recommendation model.

There are 8 independent variables:

* N : Nitrogen content in the soil
* P : Phosphorus content in the soil
* K : Potassium content in the soil
* temperature : Temperature (in Celsius)
* humidity : Humidity (in %)
* ph : pH value of the soil
* rainfall :  Rainfall in particular reason (in mm)

Target variable:
* Label: Crop suitable to grow in the particular region considering all the factors

# Model Training

* Data Preprocessing: 
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
* Feature Selection: 
Relevant features are selected for training the model.
* Model Selection: 
Various machine learning algorithms are evaluated, and the best performing algorithm is selected.
* Model Training: 
The selected algorithm is trained on the preprocessed dataset.
* Model Evaluation: 
The trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance.

# Usage
To use the trained model for prediction:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Load the trained model using the provided file (model.pkl).
* Prepare input data with the same features used during model training.
* Use the loaded model to make predictions on the input data.
